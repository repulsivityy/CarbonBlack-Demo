# Detecting Common Remote Management Tools

Purpose of this project is to build a list of well-known remote management tools and understand what files & directory it uses/touches, registry creations and modifications, and network related telemetry in order to better investigate for any suspicious or abnormal usage. 

Disclaimer: 
Not an exhaustive list, nor a complete breakdown for each tool. 


Tools analysed
- Remote Desktop Protocol (in progress)
- TightVNC (to be covered)
